### **IMPORTANT - Read if you want me to see your message**

To help reduce the amount of junk messages I get, you need to write "nospam" in your E-Mail's subject line. An example subject line could be "I enjoyed your new article nospam". [Here's](./blogs/ideas/nospam.html) why I need to do that. Thank you!

## Mastodon

I am currently trying Mastodon. You can find me [here](https://mastodon.scot/@tomprobyn), but I will probably mainly still post on this website.
