# My Now Page

*Last Updated: 14th September 2024*

## Main things
I'm currently in Edinburgh, studying [BSc UX Design](https://www.napier.ac.uk/courses/bsc-hons-user-experience-ux-design-undergraduate-fulltime) at [Napier University](https://www.napier.ac.uk/), where I'm in my third and final year. If you asked me what this page will say in a year, I'd have absolutely no idea. I'm living pretty much phone-free now; I effectively have a landline[^1] with a battery, but a lot of my reading still happens on a desktop computer. I'm also working as much as I can on this website between other things.

## Reading/browsing
I'm enjoying jumping through links on people's blogs, who I generally have found on Mastodon. I have found more useful things in a few days of that than I would have in months of using a search engine. Though I find it harder to get through physical books, I'm still trying to read Bill Bryson's [The Road To Little Dribbling](https://search.worldcat.org/title/983463013) which is incredibly funny.

I'm using both [Firefox](https://mozilla.org/firefox) and [Lynx](https://lynx.invisible-island.net) about equally at the moment, and my favourite Firefox extensions are currently [UBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/), [Vimium](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/vimium-ff/), [Redirector](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/redirector/) and [YouTube Unhook](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/youtube-recommended-videos/)

## Programming/MarkUp languages
I'm not doing a great deal of programming right now, but I'm occasionally trying new things in [LaTeX](https://tug.org/), which I am planning to use to write my Honours Project documentation this year. Tangentially, but mostly related, I am also still obsessed with the idea of [data semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_technology) and storing data *as* context, rather than data alongside context.

## Walking
Since moving back to Edinburgh last week, I've been doing a lot of walking within the city. I've walked to [Corstorphine Village](https://www.allaboutedinburgh.co.uk/corstorphine-village-edinburgh) which is beautiful, [Braid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braid_Hills) and [Blackford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackford_Hill) hills, [Inverleith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverleith), as well as just nosing around the city centre.
