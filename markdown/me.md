# About Me

I am Tom, a 20-year-old university student based in Edinburgh. I try to find the greatest joy I possibly can in things which don't cost myself, other people, or the planet, and this site acts as a bit of a shrine to that.

From the categories listed on my [home page](./) you can see my interests. 

I am reading User Experience Design (oft abbreviated to UX). Despite being a course focusing on progressing technology, I have been left with the distinct (and seemingly rather unique) idea that low technology solutions are preferable to the modern overcomplicated world in which we live. I feel we have been blinded by the singular path we have taken, and that better "realities" would exist had we followed divergent paths, rather than continually iterating one single path to death. I try to live in a way which reflects this: I use cash, buy everything I possibly can secondhand, don't really use a phone for anything except calling people and sending the occasional text, have a hand-coded website with an [RSS feed](./feed), you get the point.

Please do explore the website, and if you feel compelled, send me an [email](./email.html).
