## Music
In mid 2019, I developed an interest in music production. What started (as most things do with me) as a few days-long obsession has thus far failed to bore me to the point of terminating it (as most things do with me). I have written many pieces during that time and the styles in which I have written them has evolved accordingly. Most of the early pieces are gone (thank goodness) but some of my more up-to-date stuff remains. It's hosted mostly on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@ThomasProbyn/videos), and listed below in date order:

## Film, video and photography

Occasionally, I produce videos, which rarely subscribe to a theme or any kind of time schedule. These are:

*I am currently working on a way in which I can reasonably host photographs on this site. I am considering external hosting systems, mostly federated technology solutions, but have not yet come across anything which meets my needs.*
