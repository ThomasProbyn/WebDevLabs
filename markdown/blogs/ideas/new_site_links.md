# A new website (with some broken links)
*22 May 2024*

I have just finished updating the website (mostly)! I have migrated to an entirely new custom static site generator which I built in Python using the Markdown module. This has lots of advantages - firstly it's very simple and doesn't have any of the fluff I don't need which would be included if I had just installed a package. Secondly, I know exactly how it works, so there's no surprises when it breaks, and I can access and change the source code at will. And of course, I got to exercise my programming muscles and do a bit of problem solving, which is always a positive thing. 

However, migrating a website to a whole new system comes with its challenges. There are still pages which I have not yet updated (and which will remain legacy for now), and there may be broken links here and there. If you find a broken link, please kindly [send me an E-Mail](https://tomprobyn.uk/email.html) with a link to the page you found the broken link on, and which link it was that was broken. I think I've picked most of them up now but there may still be one or two.

I do hope you enjoy using the new site, and that the ease of pushing an update will now encourage me to write more. Have a browse of the [home page](https://tomprobyn.uk/) and see any new blogs published!
