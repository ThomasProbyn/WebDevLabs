# Frequency of blogs
*27th April 2024*

Admittedly, the intention of this site was never to become a time-consuming obsession. I never much desired to spend hours on its maintenance, and writing thousands of words every week, which is why for the past six months it has sat virtually untouched. I did not wish for this to happen either.

Thus, I have elected to attempt to write a new blog every Saturday evening, to be published on Sunday mornings. Perhaps they will not be quite as long as one may expect, though I do feel the regularity of the entries perhaps trumps their quantity.

The very first of these blogs is now on-line: [From Balerno to Edinburgh along the Water of Leith](./balerno_edinburgh.html) (in which I immediately break the rule of not writing too much!).

If you wish to know when new blogs are available (or simply be the first to know how many Sundays it takes for me to fail entirely on this promise!) the [RSS Feed](../feed/index.html) is online and available.
