# Walks

I try to write about the different walks I go on, mainly as a way of remembering them for my own pleasure. Listed below are a number of blogs as such:

 - [Balerno to Edinburgh on the Water of Leith](./balerno_edinburgh.html)
 - [Sunset at Blackford Hill](./blackford_hill_sunset.html)
 - [Sunset on the Union Canal](./union_canal_sunset.html)
