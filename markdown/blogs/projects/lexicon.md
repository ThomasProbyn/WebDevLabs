# The Lexicon: Words I (claim to) have invented

Despite its many hundred-thousands of words, the English Language rarely fails to disappoint in the most technical of needs. Occasionally the invention of a word to fill a gap is necessitated, resulting chiefly from frustration of a lack of a concise means of aptly describing the concept I wish to. Is, after all, not that the very purpose of having a language in the first place?

Below are defined some words to which, from admittedly lackadaisically awful attempts at research, I was able to find no reference to in absolutely none of the top 5 pages on Google:

- **Enprovisioned**
    1. *adj.* Furnished with provisions or items of a similar manner
- **Expedee**
    1. *adj.* One who embarks upon an expedition; "Like all good expedees, he carried a map and a compass; less dramatic than synonyms: *Syn: Explorer, Adventurer*
