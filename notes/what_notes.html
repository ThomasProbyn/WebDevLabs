<h1>Notes?</h1>
<p><em>14th September 2024</em></p>
<p>Notes are thoughts and ideas which are too long for posts on <a href="https://mastodon.scot/@tomprobyn">Mastodon</a>, but too short to be worth publishing as a proper blog post. Generally they will be a few paragraphs long and not more than 1000 words.</p>
<p>Notes seem to be a thing people are doing in the open/personal web, so I thought I'd give it a go. There have been a few times recently where I've wanted to share something trivial, but didn't see the point in (read couldn't be bothered to!) write a full blog post to accompany it. I try to keep blog posts firmly in the half-hour-read range, so a good 2500-3000 words are generally necessary.</p>
<p>Notes then seemed the way to go - short, perhaps more regular posts concerning things which are of momentary interest but don't necessarily merit a post of their own.</p></body></main></html>
