 <h1>The telephone</h1>
 <sub>1st Feb 2024</sub>
 <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>I suppose, perhaps, one could describe my prior position as being at something of a loss. I had, foregoing all but the most drastic of action, attempted everything I possibly could to reduce not only the time I spent on my phone every day, but similarly my dependence thereof. It was, though, on the evening of Monday this week when I felt a rather unexplained and sudden notion of apathy towards the device. What followed was something which I endeavor to continue.</p>
<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>One feels that, at least amongst the social circles with which I am personally affiliated, screen time readouts have lost their shock-value. It is, from personal experience of course, not uncommon to hear of people spending 10 or more hours per day using their phone. What, perhaps, is more shocking to me now is not the <i>amount</i> of time itself, but the activities which fill and characterize that time. A newly emerging group of software products based on what appears to be, from personal here-say at least, effective addiction is now one of the most common products which people choose to spend time using.</p>
<p>I am of course talking of short, vertical, user-generated video platforms. I am in the lucky position of being so utterly oblivious to the activity of my peers that these products never really caught my attention particularly. As a result, I suppose I am the rare outsider in that sense, able to offer a perspective untainted by the experience of becoming addicted to these platforms, as, it seems, many of my peers have.</p>
<p>Instead, my personal vice is in fact what could be considered the predecessors of such platforms - YouTube. I believe that I spend an inordinate amount of time on the product, and, short of the apparently baseless "internet rots your brain" babble so many articles about similar subject matter descend into, I took time instead to consider whether my time, to which I could ascribe a value, was being used to the full potential of that value when it was being used to watch YouTube. The equation is perhaps more balanced than one might initially think, as the majority of my YouTube viewing consisted of educational videos and informative pieces, but one still had to question whether the density and quality of the information which I was receiving was par to what I <i>could</i> be doing with my time.</p>
<p>I hate hypotheticals, because they form a simplistic view of the world. There is nothing simplistic about the world; anyone who tells you otherwise is a fool. I suppose, though, their one advantage is that they allow us to consider actions imposed upon a world without context or consequence. To illustrate what I mean: no, of course YouTube is not the most information-dense or highest quality source of information available. Were I to sit reading academic papers for all the time I watched YouTube I would quite easily be able to gain a much broader and well-rounded understanding of pretty much anything I wanted. And that is where the hypothetical gets you - an unrealistic answer, because despite my love for knowledge, reading papers for 10 hours a day for entertainment is not at all like watching videos for 10 hours a day for entertainment.</p>
<p>Hypotheticals aside, I knew I needed to do <i>something</i> at least.</p>
