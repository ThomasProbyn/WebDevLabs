<h1>Frequency of blogs</h1>
<p><em>27th April 2024</em></p>
<p>Admittedly, the intention of this site was never to become a time-consuming obsession. I never much desired to spend hours on its maintenance, and writing thousands of words every week, which is why for the past six months it has sat virtually untouched. I did not wish for this to happen either.</p>
<p>Thus, I have elected to attempt to write a new blog every Saturday evening, to be published on Sunday mornings. Perhaps they will not be quite as long as one may expect, though I do feel the regularity of the entries perhaps trumps their quantity.</p>
<p>The very first of these blogs is now on-line: <a href="../walks.balerno_edinburgh.html">From Balerno to Edinburgh along the Water of Leith</a> (in which I immediately break the rule of not writing too much!).</p>
<p>If you wish to know when new blogs are available (or simply be the first to know how many Sundays it takes for me to fail entirely on this promise!) the <a href="https://tomprobyn.uk/feed/">RSS Feed</a> is online and available.</p></body></html>
