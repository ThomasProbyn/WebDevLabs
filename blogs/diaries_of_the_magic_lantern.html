<p>Since the summer of last year, I have wanted to create a project a bit like the DotML. The premise is simple - every single day of the year I will do two things towards it. I will take a photograph and write a short text description or contextual piece in one sentence. You might have heard of the application &quot;BeReal&quot;, which I suppose this project is quite similar to, with the exception being that the purpose here is to contribute towards a personal project of documentation, rather than for any social purposes. Whatever I am doing on a particular day, whatever the weather, I will be attempting to contribute to the project.</p>
