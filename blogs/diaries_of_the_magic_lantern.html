<h2>An important message regarding Diaries of the Magic Lantern</h2>
<p>Recently, I have been significantly lessening my use of technology, and an important aspect of that is leaving my mobile phone at home when I go out. Naturally, this has been a tough process, though a very, very rewarding one, and I am in the process of a full writeup of my experience thus far. Sadly, though, that does mean that Diaries of the Magic Lantern will become a lot less regularly updated. Some day, I may find a way to return to the daily upload schedule, but for now, I see the process of lessening my reliance on digital technology to be more important. At some point, I will start a photos page, updated at regular though inconsistent intervals for those times when I do carry a camera with me. That will be linked here when I get round to it. For now though, thank you for looking at the Magic Lantern - it was fun whilst it lasted.</p>

<p>Since the summer of last year, I have wanted to create a project a bit like the DotML. The premise is simple - every single day of the year I will do two things towards it. I will take a photograph and write a short text description or contextual piece in one sentence. You might have heard of the application &quot;BeReal&quot;, which I suppose this project is quite similar to, with the exception being that the purpose here is to contribute towards a personal project of documentation, rather than for any social purposes. Whatever I am doing on a particular day, whatever the weather, I will be attempting to contribute to the project.</p>
