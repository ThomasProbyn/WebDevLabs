<h1 id="justifying-my-web-design-choices">Justifying my web design choices</h1>
<p>Fundamentally, the purpose of this site is to give you (albeit pretty useless) information. My primary goal is to share that information with you and this site is the medium by which I have chosen to do so. I have presented it in perhaps the most minimal means possible, so as you might do what you like with it. By using raw HTML and CSS to present this site, you can choose to use the &quot;reader&quot; mode included in many contemporary web browsers. You can even configure it to come on automatically for certain sites, such as this one, in many browsers. Or hell, download the entire site, and use some sort of HTML to document format converter to open it up and read it locally. The information is the product here, the way it is packaged is merely a bi-product of the means of transmission. </p>
<p>You could make the argument that the site is written in English and, depending on your familiarity with English, you may choose to run the page you&#39;re looking at through the translation engine of your choice. Although I presented you the information in English, I did not prescribe that that is how it <em>must</em> be read, it is simply the most convenient means for me to create a record of the information I choose to share with you. Similarly, the site is not prescribed to you in this format, you can choose to interpret it in any means necessary to help you enjoy it more.</p>
<p>My final reason is that text is not the only medium by which people choose to browse the web. Screen readers are popular, amongst both users with and without accessibility needs (some people just prefer them). </p>
<h2 id="why-make-it-look-old-then-">Why make it look old then?</h2>
<p>&quot;Old&quot; is probably not the correct term to use here. Basic is perhaps more accurate. The design of the site is also heavily defined by what you read it in, if you&#39;ve formed the opinion that it looks &quot;old&quot;, I suspect you&#39;re reading it on a contemporary browser with untweaked settings. As a result, you&#39;ll see a page with text in the default (likely Times New Roman size 12) font. Of course, it&#39;s completely up to your web browser how to display this information, I have not explicitly decreed that it must be displayed as such. So in answer to the question of &quot;why does it look old&quot;, the answer is &quot;because of your browser&quot;.</p>
<p>In reality, the above argument is a roundabout way of saying, I don&#39;t really care about web design for a small personal site. However, as I mention, I also do technically give you the flexibility to read the page however you want (and within the flexibility of your browser).</p>
<p>And yes, maybe the nostalgia factor...</p>
<h2 id="visual-design-has-its-place">Visual design has its place</h2>
<p>It is often said that the medium shapes the art (or as we call it now, &quot;content&quot;). I&#39;d argue that this can be true the other way round too, depending on your priorities as a communicator. In this case, what I want to do is share with you things about which I have an interest. Basic text on a background which your browser can shape to your preferences is good enough in this case. The stories and posts I create here are intended to be engaging enough on their own and to find their own niche audience, and if I am capable of that, I shouldn&#39;t need a visually pleasing design to try and engage the widest audience possible. However, if I wanted to sell things or what have you, visual arts is the first place I would go for that sort of thing, as it seems we happen to have an attraction to pretty things as a species; citation needed, obviously. </p>
