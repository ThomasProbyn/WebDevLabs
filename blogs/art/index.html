<h2>Music</h2>
<p>In mid 2019, I developed an interest in music production. What started (as most things do with me) as a few days-long obsession has thus far failed to bore me to the point of terminating it (as most things do with me). I have written many pieces during that time and the styles in which I have written them has evolved accordingly. Most of the early pieces are gone (thank goodness) but some of my more up-to-date stuff remains. It's hosted mostly on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ThomasProbyn/videos">YouTube</a>, and listed below in date order:</p>

<h2>Film, video and photography</h2>
<p>Occasionally, I produce videos, which rarely subscribe to a theme or any kind of time schedule. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>▶️ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a189SDio5MY">Beyond the Magic Lantern (Episode 1)</a></li>
</ul>
<p><em>I am currently working on a way in which I can reasonably host photographs on this site. I am considering external hosting systems, mostly federated technology solutions, but have not yet come across anything which meets my needs.</em></p></body></html>
