<h1>Contact me</h1>
<p>I used to have an E-Mail address on this page, but I realised that that was slightly risky in terms of GDPR. In theory it should have fallen under the "personal and household" exemption to GDPR, but I am not qualified enough to judge whether or not it actually did.

<h2>Mastodon</h2>
<p>I am currently using Mastodon. You can find me <a href="https://mastodon.scot/@tomprobyn">here</a>, but I will probably mainly still <em>post</em> on this website. Mastodon has a form of "private" (though not encrypted) messaging, which is the best way to get in contact with me.</p></body></main></html>
