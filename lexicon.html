 <h1>Words I (claim to) have invented</h1>
<p>Despite its many hundred-thousands of words, the English Language rarely fails to disappoint in the most technical of needs. Occasionally the invention of a word to fill a gap is necessitated, resulting chiefly from frustration of a lack of a concise means of aptly describing the concept I wish to. Is, after all, not that the very purpose of having a language in the first place?
</p>
<p>Below are defined some words to which, from admittedly lackadaisically awful attempts at research, I was able to find no reference to in absolutely none of the top 5 pages on Google:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Enprovisioned</b>
        <ol>
            <li><em>adj. </em>Furnished with provisions or items of a similar manner</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li><b>Expedee</b>
        <ol>
            <li><em>adj. </em>One who embarks upon an expedition; "Like all good expedees, he carried a map and a compass; less dramatic than synonyms: <em>Syn: Explorer, Adventurer</em></li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ul>
