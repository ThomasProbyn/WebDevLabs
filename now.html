<h1>My Now Page</h1>
<p><em>Last Updated: 1st October 2024</em></p>
<h2>Main things</h2>
<p>I'm currently in Edinburgh, studying <a href="https://www.napier.ac.uk/courses/bsc-hons-user-experience-ux-design-undergraduate-fulltime">BSc UX Design</a> at <a href="https://www.napier.ac.uk/">Edinburgh Napier University</a>, where I'm in my third and final year. I'm now getting in to my honours project, where I'm looking into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_pitch">Absolute Pitch</a> and the websites which exist to test for it. </p>
<p>I've actually started using my phone a little more! Whilst that might sound like a step in the wrong direction, I'm speaking over phone calls to more people, and texting less. I'm really enjoying that, it feels much more human (and <em>so</em> much more efficient than texting).</p>
<h2>Reading and watching</h2>
<p>I've been watching things far too often lately. I've decided to block all of the websites I do so on, which seems to be working well, and I've picked up many more books. I'm still in the middle of Bill Bryson's <a href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/983463013"><em>The Road to Little Dribbling</em></a>, and I've started reading a lot more about the history and sites of Edinburgh, Lothians and Borders, in a <a href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/37229140">book</a> entitled just that!</p>
<h2>Programming/MarkUp languages</h2>
<p>Whilst I'm still not doing all that much programming, I have a few ideas for little web toys I'd like to create and will possibly start them when I next get the chance. I'm in the process of trying to properly master <a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a>; I'm thinking of it as an "engine" for LaTeX. Whilst I still love LaTeX, the way that Pandoc handles citations and <a href="https://citationstyles.org/">CSLs</a> is much more up-to-date, and markdown is significantly less intrusive and requires far fewer keystrokes to get to the same result. Besides that, you can convert to far more formats than you can with LaTeX, which can be very useful. I'm tempted to switch the build process for this very site over to Pandoc soon!</p>
<h2>Walking</h2>
<p>I finally did Craiglockhart hill! It only took two years to get round to doing it, but the views are astounding, especially for such a small hill. You can see right up to the Highlands on a good day. I'm also in the vague planning stages of seeing if there's a way to walk from North Berwick back to Edinburgh in a day, but it is going to require a lot of planning for things like stops, escape routes to buses and trains etc, but I reckon it could be fun to do!</p>
<h2>Music</h2>
<p>I seem to have been taking an informal break from music recently. I've felt slightly disillusioned with it, and realise it's not going to get anywhere, and so I've been making a lot more things just for me. Without the push given from the excitement of releasing songs, I've stopped finishing them and most things I'm making are under 1 minute - which I suppose is about the length of the average pop song now - I may be on to something here!</p>
<h2>Experiments in low and no technology</h2>
<p>I'm still questioning my habits with regards to technology, and being more mindful about the way that I use things rather than just blindly using them. Currently, I'm:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not using JavaScript and not loading images on web pages. You can read my thoughts on the matter <a href="https://www.tomprobyn.uk/blogs/ideas/justifying_javascript.html">here</a></li>
<li>Exploring the idea that computers have to be online all the time. I'm still working on a means of concentrating internet usage down to 1-2 hours a day of focused activity rather than 10-12 hours a day of sporadic activity.</li>
<li>Questioning the necessity of colour on screens - I've turned off colour on my laptop, phone and watch. It makes everything a lot less appealing and less eye-grabbing. And it doesn't really degrade the experience particularly</li>
<li>Finding better ways of navigating - I take a paper OS map with me quite a lot now, and it makes you think a lot more than using GPS-based navigation</li>
<li>Looking at maximising the efficiency of both energy and water usage in washing, both humans and clothes! I've defined an imaginary ratio in the form of "amount of heated water used : amount of clean", and I was shocked by how inefficient showers, baths, washing machines etc. all are on that scale. <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2019/10/mist-showers-sustainable-decadence">This</a> article and <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2024/09/communal-luxury-the-public-bathhouse/">this</a> article may be of interest if you think this sounds intriguing.</li>
<li>Removing the fingerprint/unlock with Apple Watch functionality from my phone and computer. I now have to put a password in every time I want to use them, which requires a cognitive load to use them, often enough time to catch myself and think "is this really a necessary use of technology?".</li>
</ul>
<p>Until next month, Tom.</p>
