<h2 id="main-things">Main things</h2>
<p>I’m currently in Edinburgh, studying <a
href="https://www.napier.ac.uk/courses/bsc-hons-user-experience-ux-design-undergraduate-fulltime">BSc
UX Design</a> at <a href="https://www.napier.ac.uk/">Edinburgh Napier
University</a>, where I’m in my third and final year. I’m wading very
deep into my honours at this point; I’m now looking at the management of
antiquarian books in a digital age. I’ve had a lot of work to do with
that recently, so excuse the recent lack of blog posts/now page
updates!</p>
<h2 id="technology">Technology</h2>
<h3 id="radio">Radio</h3>
<p>I’ve been doing a lot of radio recently. I bought my very first <a
href="https://meshtastic.org/">Meshtastic</a> node, and a good old
PMR446 handset with the <a
href="https://sera.org/frequency-coordination/what-is-ctcss/">CTCSS/DCS
tones</a> disabled to open up my transmissions to as many contacts as
possible. I’m trying to join in the <a
href="https://delboyonline.blogspot.com/2020/04/uk-pmr-net-every-sunday.html">8@8
net</a> which runs every Sunday, but haven’t found a great spot to reach
people from in Edinburgh yet.</p>
<h3 id="documents-and-websites">Documents and websites</h3>
<p>I’m also still obsessing over MarkDown and using Pandoc/LaTeX. As you
may have noticed, the site works slightly differently now with a new
tagging system. I had a day “off” my honours work yesterday (read I
instead sat and wrote 700 lines of fantastically <em>terrible</em>
Python code) in order to implement the new site. The build process is
all handled by Pandoc, which does an excellent job of handling
everything uniformly and automatically. It certainly makes it a lot
easier to write new blogs - all I need to do now is write some MarkDown,
press build, wait a few minutes (that <em>terrible</em> Python script
again) for the site to build and then commit it to the repository.
GitHub Pages does its thing, and within a few minutes of clicking build
I have a fully automated blog post with all the right links in all the
right places. It is a significantly better experience than that which
preceded it - manually rebuilding things like the home page from scratch
every time it needed updating.</p>
<p>I’m also working on a <a href="https://indieweb.org/POSSE">POSSE
system</a> for my new <a href="https://tomprobyn.uk/notes">notes</a>
slashpage. This will be yet more terribly written Python, which will
take a copy of the RSS feed for notes, identify new entries, then use
the API to engage with Mastodon and cross-post. I’m looking forward to
having that done soon.</p>
<h2 id="walks">Walks</h2>
<p>Most of my walks recently have been radio-centric (ie. up hills)
which has been brilliant for fitness. It’s been very cold in Edinburgh
recently, but I really enjoy this sort of weather. It’s so fresh and
with the blue skies and sunshine, it’s just like summer but cold. It’s
been a particularly nice autumn this year I feel, certainly better than
last year’s!</p>
<h2 id="web">Web</h2>
<p>I’ve been reading most stuff from my RSS reader recently, and haven’t
had the time for a good link-hopping session, so I’ve not got any links
to share this time. The indie web takes work - whether that’s for the
people making it or the people using it, and so finding the gems can
take an awful lot of hopping around.</p>
<h2 id="future">Future</h2>
<p>I’m going to be free of coursework (for a bit at least) from around
the middle of December, when I’ll be resuming work on my research
project into the <a
href="https://sitelines.newcastle.gov.uk/SMR/5046">Ouseburn Culvert</a>.
I’m seriously looking forward to getting back to a good bit of history
after months of not being able to do all that much research!</p>
