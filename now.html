<h2 id="main-things">Main things</h2>
<p>I’m currently in Edinburgh, studying <a
href="https://www.napier.ac.uk/courses/bsc-hons-user-experience-ux-design-undergraduate-fulltime">BSc
UX Design</a> at <a href="https://www.napier.ac.uk/">Edinburgh Napier
University</a>, where I’m in my third and final year. I’m now getting in
to my honours project, where I’m looking into <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_pitch">Absolute Pitch</a>
and the websites which exist to test for it.</p>
<p>I’ve actually started using my phone a little more! Whilst that might
sound like a step in the wrong direction, I’m speaking over phone calls
to more people, and texting less. I’m really enjoying that, it feels
much more human (and <em>so</em> much more efficient than texting).</p>
<h2 id="reading-and-watching">Reading and watching</h2>
<p>I’ve been watching things far too often lately. I’ve decided to block
all of the websites I do so on, which seems to be working well, and I’ve
picked up many more books. I’m still in the middle of Bill Bryson’s <a
href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/983463013"><em>The Road to
Little Dribbling</em></a>, and I’ve started reading a lot more about the
history and sites of Edinburgh, Lothians and Borders, in a <a
href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/37229140">book</a> entitled just
that!</p>
<h2 id="programmingmarkup-languages">Programming/MarkUp languages</h2>
<p>Whilst I’m still not doing all that much programming, I have a few
ideas for little web toys I’d like to create and will possibly start
them when I next get the chance. I’m in the process of trying to
properly master <a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a>; I’m thinking
of it as an “engine” for LaTeX. Whilst I still love LaTeX, the way that
Pandoc handles citations and <a
href="https://citationstyles.org/">CSLs</a> is much more up-to-date, and
markdown is significantly less intrusive and requires far fewer
keystrokes to get to the same result. Besides that, you can convert to
far more formats than you can with LaTeX, which can be very useful. I’m
tempted to switch the build process for this very site over to Pandoc
soon!</p>
<h2 id="walking">Walking</h2>
<p>I finally did Craiglockhart hill! It only took two years to get round
to doing it, but the views are astounding, especially for such a small
hill. You can see right up to the Highlands on a good day. I’m also in
the vague planning stages of seeing if there’s a way to walk from North
Berwick back to Edinburgh in a day, but it is going to require a lot of
planning for things like stops, escape routes to buses and trains etc,
but I reckon it could be fun to do!</p>
<h2 id="music">Music</h2>
<p>I seem to have been taking an informal break from music recently.
I’ve felt slightly disillusioned with it, and realise it’s not going to
get anywhere, and so I’ve been making a lot more things just for me.
Without the push given from the excitement of releasing songs, I’ve
stopped finishing them and most things I’m making are under 1 minute -
which I suppose is about the length of the average pop song now - I may
be on to something here!</p>
<h2 id="experiments-in-low-and-no-technology">Experiments in low and no
technology</h2>
<p>I’m still questioning my habits with regards to technology, and being
more mindful about the way that I use things rather than just blindly
using them. Currently, I’m:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not using JavaScript and not loading images on web pages. You can
read my thoughts on the matter <a
href="https://www.tomprobyn.uk/blogs/ideas/justifying_javascript.html">here</a></li>
<li>Exploring the idea that computers have to be online all the time.
I’m still working on a means of concentrating internet usage down to 1-2
hours a day of focused activity rather than 10-12 hours a day of
sporadic activity.</li>
<li>Questioning the necessity of colour on screens - I’ve turned off
colour on my laptop, phone and watch. It makes everything a lot less
appealing and less eye-grabbing. And it doesn’t really degrade the
experience particularly</li>
<li>Finding better ways of navigating - I take a paper OS map with me
quite a lot now, and it makes you think a lot more than using GPS-based
navigation</li>
<li>Looking at maximising the efficiency of both energy and water usage
in washing, both humans and clothes! I’ve defined an imaginary ratio in
the form of “amount of heated water used : amount of clean”, and I was
shocked by how inefficient showers, baths, washing machines etc. all are
on that scale. <a

article and <a
href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2024/09/communal-luxury-the-public-bathhouse/">this</a>
article may be of interest if you think this sounds intriguing.</li>
<li>Removing the fingerprint/unlock with Apple Watch functionality from
my phone and computer. I now have to put a password in every time I want
to use them, which requires a cognitive load to use them, often enough
time to catch myself and think “is this really a necessary use of
technology?”.</li>
