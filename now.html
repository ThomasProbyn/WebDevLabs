<h1 class="title" id="maincontent">My Now Page</h1>
<p class="date">Last Updated: 1st December 2024</p>
</header>
<h2 id="main-things">Main things</h2>
<p>I’m currently in Edinburgh, studying <a
href="https://www.napier.ac.uk/courses/bsc-hons-user-experience-ux-design-undergraduate-fulltime">BSc
UX Design</a> at <a href="https://www.napier.ac.uk/">Edinburgh Napier
University</a>, where I’m in my third and final year. I’m almost
finished my Honours scoping document, which is very exciting, and am
going to attempt to finish it today! After that, I’ve got a bit more
university work to do but I’ve left the most creative until last so that
I’ll enjoy it.</p>
<h2 id="technology">Technology</h2>
<h3 id="the-site">The site</h3>
<p>I’m still working on the upgrade to the site I did a few weeks ago.
I’m a lot happier with it now (although the build code is still a trifle
messy, and I want to organise it to be a lot cleaner). There’s two
updated I need to make happen: firstly I want to know why it takes
(almost) exponentially longer to build every time I add a new page.
Really, this should be a case of <code>O(n)</code>, and I want to find
out why it isn’t and hopefully fix it. I’ve got some ideas.</p>
<p>But ultimately, the new codebase is allowing me to be a lot more
proactive with the site. There’s a huge amount more semantic separation,
so I’m much more comfortable writing and confident that in doing so I’m
not likely to break anything. This week, I’ve just been tweaking the
theme slightly, and given that I’m not <em>entirely</em> happy, I’m
going to be doing a little more work on that.</p>
<h3 id="posse">POSSE</h3>
<p>As I’ve been bogged down with other things recently, I’ve been
putting off implementing my <a
href="https://www.tomprobyn.uk/blogs/static_site_generator_lessons.html">proposed</a>
<a href="https://https://indieweb.org/POSSE">POSSE</a> system. I am
looking at implementing an open-source alternative as I’ve really just
not had the chance to get to grips with the Mastodon API. It will
happen, it’s sat next to me on my To-Do list staring at me eagerly right
now, and I cannot <em>wait</em> to cross it off!</p>
<h3 id="data-caps-idea">Data caps idea</h3>
<p>For all this iteration of the now page is meant to be in the month
when I’m handing things in for university, I seem to be having quite a
few ideas! This one sprang into mind the other week, and it stems from
my idea for an implementation of <a
href="https://www.tomprobyn.uk/blogs/the_slow_line.html">slowing down
the internet</a>. Incidentally, that implementation no longer works, as
I had to plug in the laptop running it with an ethernet cable as it’s
also now running as a local server, which made the “slow” internet
hotspot run much too fast!</p>
<p>Anyway, this idea is similar and one I might implement when I get
some more time. Instead of allowing the same access to a slower version
of the internet, this system uses the idea of data caps that we had
maybe 10 years ago. They don’t seem to really be a thing in the UK any
more, if you’re on Wi-Fi, you can download/upload an unlimited amount of
data all day every day, but I remember when I was a child you couldn’t
download or upload more than 20GB a month. It made me (and more my
parents!) very conscious of my YouTube habits, and I wonder what the
psychological impact of re-introducing such a thing might be. I will try
and build an implementation over Christmas and see.</p>
<h2 id="walks">Walks</h2>
<p>Sadly, I’ve not had all that much time for walking this month. <a
href="https://www.tomprobyn.uk/blogs/first_snow_24.html">The snow</a>
was nice, and I’ve still been up on the hills at night trying to catch
people on the 8@8 PMR net with little luck sadly. I won’t have much time
for walks until deadlines I suspect.</p>
<h2 id="web">Web</h2>
<p>I’ve been reading most stuff from my RSS reader recently, and haven’t
had the time for a good link-hopping session, so I’ve not got any links
to share this time. The indie web takes work - whether that’s for the
people making it or the people using it, and so finding the gems can
take an awful lot of hopping around.</p>
<h2 id="future">Future</h2>
<p>I’m really looking forward to resuming work on my research project
into the <a href="https://sitelines.newcastle.gov.uk/SMR/5046">Ouseburn
Culvert</a>! I’ve also been doing some research into the early stages of
the Tyne and Wear Metro, which has been seriously interesting. A lot of
very in-depth reports and documents out there.</p>
