<h1>My Now Page</h1>
<p><em>Last Updated: 14th September 2024</em></p>
<h2>Main things</h2>
<p>I'm currently in Edinburgh, studying <a href="https://www.napier.ac.uk/courses/bsc-hons-user-experience-ux-design-undergraduate-fulltime">BSc UX Design</a> at <a href="https://www.napier.ac.uk/">Napier University</a>, where I'm in my third and final year. If you asked me what this page will say in a year, I'd have absolutely no idea. I'm living pretty much phone-free now; I effectively have a landline<sup id="fnref2:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> with a battery, but a lot of my reading still happens on a desktop computer. I'm also working as much as I can on this website between other things.</p>
<h2>Reading/browsing</h2>
<p>I'm enjoying jumping through links on people's blogs, who I generally have found on Mastodon. I have found more useful things in a few days of that than I would have in months of using a search engine. Though I find it harder to get through physical books, I'm still trying to read Bill Bryson's <a href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/983463013">The Road To Little Dribbling</a> which is incredibly funny.</p>
<p>I'm using both <a href="https://mozilla.org/firefox">Firefox</a> and <a href="https://lynx.invisible-island.net">Lynx</a> about equally at the moment, and my favourite Firefox extensions are currently <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/">UBlock Origin</a>, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/vimium-ff/">Vimium</a>, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/redirector/">Redirector</a> and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/youtube-recommended-videos/">YouTube Unhook</a></p>
<h2>Programming/MarkUp languages</h2>
<p>I'm not doing a great deal of programming right now, but I'm occasionally trying new things in <a href="https://tug.org/">LaTeX</a>, which I am planning to use to write my Honours Project documentation this year. Tangentially, but mostly related, I am also still obsessed with the idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_technology">data semantics</a> and storing data <em>as</em> context, rather than data alongside context.</p>
<h2>Walking</h2>
<p>Since moving back to Edinburgh last week, I've been doing a lot of walking within the city. I've walked to <a href="https://www.allaboutedinburgh.co.uk/corstorphine-village-edinburgh">Corstorphine Village</a> which is beautiful, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braid_Hills">Braid</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackford_Hill">Blackford</a> hills, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverleith">Inverleith</a>, as well as just nosing around the city centre.</p>
