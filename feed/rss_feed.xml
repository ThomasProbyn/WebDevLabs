  <description>Tom Probyn's personal website, for anything I find marginally interesting and worth sharing.</description>

    <title>Complete website rebuild!</title>
    <link>https://tomprobyn.uk</link>
    <description>Since getting an entirely new URL for the site, I decided to entirely re-build and restructure it. Now, everything is built on Markdown and compiled to HTML using a Python Script, and the process of writing is significantly smoother than it was before (having to wrangle with HTML manually). There aren't too many user-facing changes (apart from the new structure and URL) so you should still feel comfortable navigating, but do stop by the entirely new home page and have a good old poke around!</description>
