<p><em>&quot;Utterly random musical ideas presented for your enjoyment.&quot;</em></p>
<p>In mid 2019, I developed an interest in music production. What started (as most things do with me) as a few days-long obsession has thus far failed to bore me to the point of terminating it (as most things do with me). I have written many pieces during that time and the styles in which I have written them has evolved accordingly. Most of the early pieces are gone (thank goodness) but some of my more up-to-date stuff remains. It&#39;s hosted mostly on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ThomasProbyn/videos">YouTube</a>, and listed below in date order:</p>

<p>At some point I will probably start a service offering this, but for now, I write pieces offering advice and wisdoms from my own experience of doing it below.</p>
<p>And for anyone interested, I use <a href="http://reaper.fm/">REAPER</a> (and now <a href="https://apple.com/logic-pro">Logic</a> too!) after trying pretty much every single DAW on the planet.</p>
